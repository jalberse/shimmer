# Shimmer

Shimmer is a physically based rendering system based on the ray tracing algorithm. It is currently under development.

# Acknowledgements

Shimmer is largely based on the pbrt-v4 rendering system from [pbrt.org](https://pbrt.org/), following "Physically Based Rendering: From Threory to Implementation" (fourth ed.) by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob, and Greg Humphreys. While the pbrt-v4 source code is not present in this project (being developed in C++), its license (Apache License 2.0) is still included at licenses/pbrt.txt.

Portions of this code were written referencing rs-pbrt, a Rust implementation of PBRT v3, under the MIT license. That license is present in this repository at licenses/rs_pbrt.txt.
