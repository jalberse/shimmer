//! Why are there distinct types for **Vector** and **Point** and
//! **Normal**? Why not just use a unified vector class? Because they
//! are not the same, so let's capture that with our ~type system~.
//!
//! All **vectors** v in an affine space can be expressed as a linear
//! combination of the basis vectors:
//!
//! v = s_1 * v_1 + ... + s_n * v_n
//!
//! The scalars s_i are the representation of v with respect to the basis.
//!
//! Similarly, for all **points** p and origin p_0, there are unique scalars s_i
//! such that the point can be expressed in terms of the origin p_0 and
//! the basis vectors:
//!
//! p = p_0 + s_1 * v_1 + ... + s_n * v_n
//!
//! So, while vectors and points are both represented by 3 x, y, z values
//! in 3D space, they are distinct mathematical entities and not freely
//! interchangeable. Having separate types can therefore be more easily
//! understood and reasoned with, and allows us to handle them in different
//! manners as necessary (e.g points don't have a length).
//!
//! A **surface normal** (or a **normal**) is a vector perpendicular to a
//! surface at a particular position. Although normals are superficially
//! similar to vectors, it is important to distinguish between them
//! in the type system as well: because normals are defined in terms of
//! their relationship to a particular surface, they behave differently
//! than vectors in some situations, particularly when applying transformations.

// This module contains traits (Tuple, Length, Normalize, etc) which are created
// to allow us to share logic across our various types (Vectors, Normals, Points).
// However, we don't export the traits, and make their functions available within
// the public structs (calling the trait implementation). This way, users don't
// need to import the traits to use the structs.

// We use glam as it is a optimized vector math library which includes SIMD optimization.
// We wrap the glam vector classes using the newtype pattern. This accomplishes two things:
//  1. Points, Vectors, and Normals can be defined as distinct types,
//     which is useful as they are distinct mathematical entities and should be treated as such, and
//  2. It allows for us to deviate from glam's implementations of certain operations as needed,
//     and include/exclude operations for each type as appropriate for each type.
//
// A disadvantage of the newtype approach is the associated boilerplate, and some arguably unnecessary abstraction,
// such as being unable to access x, y, z directly (requiring getters or tuple access, i.e. some_vec.0.x).
// But, this trade-off is worth it to be able to leverage the type system for correctness.
// The newtype pattern should have no associated runtime cost here, optimized by the compiler.

// TODO Our impl_op_ex* methods are not all tested; test them.

// TODO Run a test coverage software and ensure full coverage. I know I'm missing a bit. https://lib.rs/crates/cargo-llvm-cov
//   Also hook that up into GitHub actions.

// TODO ensure we debug_assert() with has_nan() where appropriate.

// TODO also implement the list of functions on page 85
